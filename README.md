# React + Vite

# Click Event

- An interaction occurs when user clicks on specific element.
- We can respond to the clicks by passing a callback to onClick event handler.

- Key Point: In Button.jsx at function handleClick2 we are passing name as parameter but there is minor twist if we directly call the function then without click it will render the data so we are using arrow function in the return statement.

- ButonB.jsx file has the code which tells the console how many times a user has clicked on the button.
